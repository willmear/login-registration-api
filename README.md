# login-registration-api

Learning how to build login and registration backend api using Java.

I spent a lot of time reading Spring boot documentation and watching many different tutorial videos, with many different failed attempts, before settling on this method of building a simple login/ registration API. This has helped me solidify my understanding on the basics of RESTful APIs.

My API implements basic security, encoding user passwords when registering and only allowing access to the login page before logging in. The API will then authorise access.
